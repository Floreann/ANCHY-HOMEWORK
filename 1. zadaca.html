      <p><h4></h4>The travelling gnome or roaming gnome is a garden gnome lawn ornament<br>
                          brought on a trip and photographed in front of famous landmarks.<br>
                          The practice is called gnoming. Some instances have become national and international news stories,<br>
                          where people have stolen a garden gnome from a garden, and then sent the owner photos of the gnome<br>
                          for a period of time as a practical joke, before returning it.</p>

      <p>The concept of the travelling gnome dates back to the 1970s when Henry Sunderland<br> photographed his own garden gnomes, which he named Harry and Charlie, while he was travelling around Antarctica.<br>

        The earliest record of a prank involving a travelling gnome is from Australia in 1986 when the Sydney Morning Herald reported that an <br> "Eastern Suburbs gnome-owner was distressed when she discovered her gnome had been stolen at the weekend. A note was found in its place: <br> <i><h3>'Dear mum, couldn't stand the solitude any longer. Gone off to see the world. Don't be worried, I'll be back soon. Love Bilbo xxx.'"</h3></i></p>
